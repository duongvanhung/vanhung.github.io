Block Game Producing
1. Unity Version: 2019.4.27f1
2. After clicking on a specific block, two germs' positions will be switched if you click on another block on their left/right/up/down.
3. Germ size: 8x8
4. If you gather more than 3 blocks, they'll explode and you'll get extra points.
5. After the blocks have been exploded, upper blocks will fall down to fill up their spaces.
6. When starting the game and moving the block, use "Debug.Log" to check if there are any germs left to blow up.
7. Create the "Pause" Button in the game. If you click Pause, the screen is dimmed off a bit and there's a Reset button appearing in the middle.
8. If there are no germs left to blow up, make the screen dimmed off a bit and lay the Reset button in the middle.
